TurboGears-1.1.x is supposed to be compatible with TurboGears-1.0.x but we've
run into several problems in the apps we've written in Fedora.  This file lists
the known incompatibilities and how to fix them.

IdentityWrapper has moved
=========================

turbogears.identity has been reorganized.  In particular,
turbogears.identity.IdentityWrapper has been moved to
turbogears.identity.base.IdentityWrapper.  You can use code like this to work
with both 1.0 and 1.1::
    try:
        from turbogears.identity import IdentityWrapper
    except ImportError:
        from turbogears.identity.base import IdentityWrapper

Widget Change
=============

There's been changes to how widgets render.  In particular, when rendering a
widget written in kid in a genshi template, the following code no longer
works::
    ${HTML(widget.render())}

You can use this instead::
    ${ET(widget.display())}
