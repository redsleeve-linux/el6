- Upstream equivalency with 5.1.3 patch.

  Resolves: rhbz#633449
- Add support for s390x compressed/filtered dumpfiles generated by 
  makedumpfile.
  Resolves: rhbz#637197
- Fix for the "bt" command with 2.6.27 and later x86_64 kernels to
  prevent the possible display of a an invalid "vgettimeofday" frame
  above the topmost "system_call_fastpath" frame, followed by two
  read errors indicating "bt: read error: kernel virtual address:
  ffffffffff600000  type: gdb_readmem_callback".
  Resolves: rhbz#637735
- Save the per-cpu register contents stored in the "cpu" devices of 
  x86_64 KVM dumpfiles, and use their contents for x86_64 backtrace RSP
  and RIP hooks in the case of KVM "live dumps" where the guest system 
  was not in a crashed state when the "virsh dump" operation was done
  on the KVM host.  If an active task was running in user space when 
  a live dump was taken, that will be indicated by the "bt" output, 
  along with the user-space register contents.  The x86_64 register set 
  saved for each cpu may be displayed with the "help -[D|n]" command.
- Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command to more correctly find the starting
  backtrace RIP and RSP hooks in KVM dumpfiles.  Without the patch,
  backtraces that should start in the interrupt or exception stacks
  were not being detected correctly.
  Resolves: rhbz#649050
- Fix to utilize the correct "cpu" device format in x86 KVM dumpfiles
  Without the patch, the x86 registers were read in a 32-bit format, 
  which is only true if the host machine was running a 32-bit kernel.
  With the patch, the format defaults to the 64-bit format, and is
  switched to the 32-bit format if it can be determined that the host
  machine was running a 32-bit kernel.
- Save the per-cpu register contents stored in the "cpu" devices of
  x86 KVM dumpfiles, and use their contents for x86 backtrace ESP and
  EIP hooks in the case of KVM "live dumps", i.e., where the guest
  system was not in a crashed state when the "virsh dump" operation
  was done on the KVM host.  If an active task was running in user
  space when a live dump was taken, that will be indicated by the
  "bt" output, along with the user-space register contents.  The saved
  x86 register set for each cpu may also be displayed with the
  "help -[D|n]" command.
- Fix for the x86 "bt" command to correctly find the starting backtrace
  EIP and ESP hooks for the active tasks in KVM dumpfiles where the
  kernel had crashed.
  Resolves: rhbz#649051
- Fix for the cpu count determination in crashed x86 KVM dumpfiles, 
  where the non-crashing cpus are marked offline in the kernel's
  cpu_online_mask by smp_stop_cpu().  Depending upon the cpu number
  of the crashing task, the cpu count may be set to a value that is
  less than the number of present cpus.
- Change to the manner in which the cpu count is determined for x86_64
  kernels.  SLES11 2.6.32 kernels delay the call to crash_kexec() until
  after smp_send_stop() is called by panic(), and so the cpu_online_map
  cannot be used for determining the cpu count.  With the patch, the
  cpu_present_map is used.
  Resolves: rhbz#649053
- Rebase to upstream version 5.1.1.

* Wed Aug 18 2010 Dave Anderson <anderson@redhat.com> - 5.0.0-23.el6

  Resolves: rhbz#562948

* Tue Feb 02 2010 Dave Anderson <anderson@redhat.com> - 5.0.0-5.el6
- Fix for the "struct" and "union" commands when passed an address that
  is in a valid kernel virtual address region but is either unmapped or
  non-existent.  Without the patch, the following three error messages
  are displayed:
    struct <name> struct: invalid kernel virtual address: <kernel-address>  type: "gdb_readmem_callback"
    gdb called without error_hook: Cannot access memory at address <kernel-address>
    *** glibc detected *** crash: double free or corruption (!prev): <crash-address> ***
  followed by a backtrace and the crash utility memory map.  The session
  aborts at that point.  With the fix, the commands will fail gracefully
  after displaying error messages reporting that the kernel virtual
  address cannot be accessed.
  Resolves: rhbz#561048

- Fix for x86, s390, s390x (and ia64) architectures to set the system
  cpu count equal to the highest cpu online plus one.  Without the
  patch, those architectures would use the number of online cpus as
  the system's total cpu count, which would be misleading when any
  offline cpu number was less than the highest online cpu number.
  Resolves: rhbz#559262
- Fix to recognize the symbol type change of per-cpu variables from
  'd' or 'D' to 'V' in 2.6.32 kernels.

  Resolves: rhbz#549243
- Fix for 2.6.31 or later x86_64 CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES kernels
  running on systems that have multiple NUMA nodes.  By default, those
  kernels use the "page" (or "lpage") percpu memory allocators, which 
  utilize vmalloc space for percpu memory.
