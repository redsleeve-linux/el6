setroubleshoot GUI. Application that allows you to view setroubleshoot-server 
messages.
Provides tools to help diagnose SELinux problems. When AVC messages
are generated an alert can be generated that will give information
about the problem and help track its resolution. Alerts can be configured
to user preference. The same tools can be run on existing log files.

- update code for command line log file scanning to work with
   new log file scanning code introduced for the browser.

- update Bulgarian translation (Doncho N. Gunchev (gunchev@gmail.com))

- update Polish translation (Piotr Drąg (raven@pmail.pl))

- Resolves bug 239893: sealert wakes up very often
   This was caused by the use of threads and pygtk's thread signal
   handling.  The only use of threads in sealert was for log file
   scanning so that the UI would remain responsive during a
   scan. Threads in sealert have now been completely
   removed. Instead the scanning work is performed in a gobject idle
   function called from the main loop. The idle function is written
   as a python generator function which allows for the function to
   perform a small amount of work, save it's execution state and
   return. The next time the idle function is called from the main
   loop it resumes execution from it's last state until it decides
   to yield control again. This way the long running scan/analysis
   can be performed in small successive units of work during the
   time the application is otherwise idle and it does not interfere
   with the rest of the GUI event processing. Everything now occurs
   in an event loop, think of it as the applications process/thread
   scheduler whose event handlers execute time slices.

- rewrote parts of the audit input pipeline to use generators
   instead of callbacks, thus permitting the logfile scanning code
   to yield control with more granularity. Also updated
   test_setroubleshootd and audisp_listen to use the new
   generator/yield logic.

- rewrote the dialog used for scanning log files, progress bar
   updates are now in the dialog, the scan can be terminated part
   way through, errors from the scan are reported in pop-up dialog,
   one can only dismiss the dialog with success if the scan had
   been successfully run to completion, otherwise the user is only
   left with the option to cancel.

- Relates bug 252035  bug 247469, setroubleshootd and sealert should
   exit if SELinux is disabled.

- add utility functions escape_html() and unescape_html()

- fix initial sort order in browser, track sort order in browser

- modify AVC.get_path() to only return a value if the 'path' field is
   set, formerly it also considered the fields 'name' & 'file' which were
   incorrect. get_path() now also looks to see if the string begins with a
   slash for a fully qualified path, if not it looks to see if its a 
   pseudo path such as 'pipe[12345]' or 'socket[12345]' and if so strips out
   the instance information inside the brackets and returns just the type of 
   the pseudo path. This is done because we do not want path information
   in the signature to be unique for each instance of the denial.

- modify the TimeStamp class to hide it's internal datetime member,
   remove the cmp() method, the internal __cmp__ will be automatically invoked.

- require selinux policy version in spec file to allow system dbus use

   and binary formats, can be selected by command line arg. It can now
   either output to clients connecting on a socket or to stdout. Can
   now optionally exit after N socket client connections.

- remove non audit record lines from test data

- remove config_init() and log_init() from package __init__.py
   It was the wrong place to call them, now call them when the
   process initializes before the first setroubleshoot imports

- add parse_config_setting() and set_config() to config module
- setroubleshootd now accepts -c --config command line arg
- test_sectroubleshoot: add err defines & program_error exception

   log the unrecognized line if not valid, clean up socket close()

- Relates Bug #247056, update initscript to LSB standards
   Note: LSB initscripts in Fedora is not yet a resolved issue,
   the changes implemented were to add an LSB block and support
   the new LSB try-restart and force-reload commands. However
   the new /lib/lsb/init-functions are NOT currently used as this
   is the unstable part.

- Fixes 221850
   plugin module loading was failing in python 2.5 with the message
   "SystemError: Parent module 'plugins' not loaded". This is due to a
   change in behavior between python 2.4 and 2.5, in python 2.4 the lack
   of a parent module was silently ignored. The fix is to load
   plugins.__init__ first.
 
* Sat Jan  6 2007 John Dennis <jdennis@redhat.com> - 1.8.13-1
- update translations

- change SETroubleshootDatabase so it is optional if it's backed
   by a file, this fixes the problem of us littering temporary files
   when scanning logfiles which does not require persistence.

- disable the view logfile menu item if no logfile has been opened

- fix redundant log messages for case where there is no log file and
   the console flag is set. When there is no log file the logging
   module opens a console stream, thus the console stream produced
   by the console flag was redundant.

- add username and password command line arguments
   rework startup logic so that all command line args are processed
   before we do any real work
 
- rework the email preferences so that each email address can
   have a filter type associated with it.

   add a new filter_type "Ignore After First Alert" which filters
   after the first alert has been delivered

- add UI for setting the email addresses alerts are sent to.
   Add menu item to edit email list, add email list dialog.
   Remove 'recipient' config file entry, now list is stored
   in seperate file. Add rpc to query and set the email list,
   the GUI calls this to get the current list from the server
   and set it in the server, it is the server which reads and 
   writes the file. Add 'enable' flag to each email entry.
   Modify how the server iterates over the email list when it
   receives an alert. When marking an alert as having been sent
   the username is the email address but with 'email:' prepended so
   as not to collide with non-email filtering options for the same user.

   "If view is set to "hide delete" you cannot filter new entries"
   Actually, the bug was toggle cell renderer was connected to the
   base model instead of the model attached to the view, the sort
   model, this meant the toggle was occuring on the wrong row if
   the view was sorted differently than the base model.

- dispatcher.py: rework how audit messages injected into the
   system and processed. Much of this work was in support of log file
   scanning which should be coupled to the exact same processing code
   as audit messages arriving from the audit socket. In essence log
   file scanning synthesizes an audit message and we inject it into
   the system the same way socket messages are injected. This was
   also an excellent moment correctly handle out of order audit
   messages, something we were not able to handle previously. This
   may have been contributing to splitting what should have been a
   single alert into two or more separate alerts because we didn't
   recongize the incoming audit events as a single event. Correctly
   assembling out of order messages introduced a fair amount of extra
   complexity as we now maintain a cache of recent audit events, this
   is fully documented in dispatcher.py
- Turn notifications back on by default.

- make browser window hidden by default so it does not flash
   when it's first realized, connect to the "realize" signal to
   initially position the vpane, add signal handlers to track
   when the browser is visible, the presentation of the status
   icon now checks if the browser is visible, the status icon is
   not presented if the browser is already displayed.

- Add avc_syslog to syslog translated avc message
- Fix submitbug button
    [John Dennis <jdennis@redhat.com>]
- fix signature inflation, all data attached to a signature is now
   encapsulated in a SEFaultSignatureInfo (siginfo) class. The GUI no
   longer reaches into a signature looking for information, it looks
   in the siginfo. The Plugin class now defines the method
   get_signature() which report() calls to obtain the signature. The
   default signature provided by the Plugin class includes the
   analysisID, an AVC with just the src & target contexts, and the
   object_path. All data accesses and parameters which had been "sig
   and solution" are now done via the unified siginfo class. There is
   still a bit more work to be done on this but this represents a
   reasonble point to checkpoint the code in CVS.

- add support to sealert to listen on a dbus session signal to display
   the gui. This is needed for when the status icon is not visible and
   the user wants to see the UI. There is now a seperate program
   setroubleshoot_launch_gui which emits the signal.

- load_plugins() now catches exceptions when a plugin won't load,
   reports the traceback in the log file, and continues with the next
   plugin. Previously a bad plugin caused the entire plugin loading
   to abort and no plugins were loaded.
- Add "daemon_name" to automake variables, change pid file to match
- turn off "noreplace" on config file till things settle down a bit
- browser.py now validates data, also test for missing column data in the
   cell_data function to avoid exceptions.

   under /var/log now, the user app's do it in /tmp, change file
   permissions on /var/log/setroubleshoot back to 0644.

- add first seen, last seen, and report count to alert detail view
- make the seen icon work, if the alert has been displayed more
   than N seconds, mark the alert as having been seen by the user
   and update the icon is the list view
- change the schema for the xml data; the database now has a version,
   there is a local id attached to each signature, the filter list in
   the siginfo was replaced by a list of per user data, the per user
   data now contains the filter, seen_flag. Modify all the code which
   was operating on the filter information to use the new model.
- fix the xml serialization so that booleans can be used as a basic
   type and also so that non-string types can be used in element
   attributes (e.g. int, bool) and the serialization code will
   automatically convert between python types and strings.

- clean up and rework the timestamp code in util.py so that
   time zones are handled properly, there were a number of bugs.
   Hopefully it's correct now because timezone handling is a pain.
- change the time format in the browser so all times are displayed
   identically, the friendly time relative format was hard to compare.
- modify the plugin 'make install' to delete all existing plugin's
   prior to installing the new ones
- add popup menu to status icon to choose between browser and
   alert GUI (not fully connected yet). Several bug fixes related
   to changing the filter_type from a string to an int.
- add filter selection to bottom pane, change filter_type from
   string to integer constant. Enhance how columns are handled.
   Get init_combo_box to work. Remove unused RPM and Bugzilla
   fields from bottom pane. Modify the default size of the browser
   window. Fix missing import in util.py.
- add ability in broswer to sort on columns, initially the report
   count column and the last seen date column. The date column now
   stores a TimeStamp object instead of a string. Add new method
   to TimeStamp to return a friendly string relative to the current
   time. The date column in the browser now has a cell data function
   which invokes the friendly format method of the TimeStamp object.
- add ability fo serialize to/from xml for classes which can
   inititialized from strings and serialized as strings (e.g. numbers,
   TimeStamps, etc.)
- add count of how many times a signature is reported, the date
   when first and last reported, add columns for report count and
   last date count to browser.
